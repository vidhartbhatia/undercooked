This is a VR cooking game where you must toss the ingredients into the cooking pots in a timely manner, or before the kitchen catches on fire. You are rewarded for accuracy and punished for having a dirty kitchen. My role on the team was programming the physics and general gameplay mechanics, as well as some sound design. This game was developed in the Fall of 2018 for Tom Corbett's class, Research Issues in Game Development (53-451).
